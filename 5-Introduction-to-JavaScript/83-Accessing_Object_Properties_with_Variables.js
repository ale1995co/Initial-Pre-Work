// Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
//This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
// Setup
var testObj = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line;

var playerNumber = 16;       // Change this Line
var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this Line
